    <h1>---------------------------------------------------</h1>
    <h3>when she was growing up, she was sort of a tomboy. Which means she was a girl who liked "boy" things.</h3>
    <h3>She had also been writing stories after she learned how to read. She said she loved making up her own stories</h3>
    <h3>When her friend got beaten up on the street, she wrote a story about her friend getting beaten up and it turned out as the bestselling book The Outsiders</h3>
    <h3>Who would think that some random sixteen year old could write a bestselling book</h3>
    <h3>Fun fact the book sold over 15 million copies</h3>
    <h3> </h3>
